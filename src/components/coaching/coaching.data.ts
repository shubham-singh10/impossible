  description: "Executive Coaching helps not only aspiring leaders, but also well-established Executives to define their direction through a series of powerful and purposeful conversations. It is important to define the chosen direction based on the leaderâ€™s personal values and their true unrealized potential. Both values and potential are revealed further through the use of powerful coaching tools as part of the overall coaching process. In Global organizations and more rapidly changing business environment it is expected that Executive Coaching will be needed for many managers as they navigate their path to the C-Suite and for Executives already within the C-Suite for improved performance, job satisfaction and motivation.",
